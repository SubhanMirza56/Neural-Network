## 📘 What is a Neural Network?

A **Neural Network** is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected "neurons" that learn patterns from data and make predictions.

Each layer is made up of **neurons**, and each connection has a **weight** and a **bias**. Learning happens through **forward propagation**, **loss calculation**, and **backpropagation**.

## 🔍 Types of Neural Networks

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Fully Connected (FCN / MLP) | Tabular data, classification, regression |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Images, video, vision tasks |
| Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) | Time series, language modeling |
| Autoencoders | Dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection |
| Transformers | NLP, sequence-to-sequence tasks |
